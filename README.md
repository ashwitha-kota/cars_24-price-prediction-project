# 🚗 Cars24 Price Prediction  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project predicts the **resale price of cars** using machine learning models.  
The dataset (from Cars24) contains information such as car brand, model year, fuel type, transmission, kilometers driven, and more.  
The aim is to build a model that estimates the fair resale price of a car.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Clean and preprocess the dataset.  
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.  
- Apply **feature engineering** and prepare data for modeling.  
- Train and evaluate multiple ML models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).  
- Select the best model for price prediction.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`  
- Tools: Google colab

## 🔍 Methodology  
1. Data Cleaning → Missing values, duplicates, outliers.  
2. EDA → Correlation, feature distributions, price trends.  
3. Feature Engineering → Encoding categorical variables, scaling.  
4. Model Training → Comparing ML models.  
5. Evaluation → MAE, RMSE, R² score.  
6. Final Model → Best-performing algorithm used for predictions.
